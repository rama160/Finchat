# FinChat AI Contract

AI is supporting intelligence, not source of truth.

## AI must not
- write the database directly;
- invent amounts, dates, totals, or transactions;
- bypass validation;
- silently replace a confirmed user category;
- overwrite confirmed transactions;
- assume missing data as fact.

## Fallback rule
Local parser runs first. AI is called only when local parsing cannot confidently resolve the input.

## Validation
Application validates type, amount, date, category, confidence, and context before persistence.

## Failure behavior
If AI fails, preserve the original input, allow manual correction, and never lose a transaction.

## Financial answers
Use application-computed facts from local data. AI should explain results, not manufacture financial records.
